This distribution is for the bioperl CORBA server applications. You
will need both bioperl and CORBA::ORBit to run this. (available on
CPAN) which itself needs Error.pm.

README.bioperl-corba is the README shared with bioper-corba-client
distribution about how the whole architecture hangs together. Read
that first.

This distribution has the following source directories:

Bio/CorbaServer/ - the wrapper objects which wrap bioperl objects
                   as BioCorba objects

servers          - perl scripts which build some objects and then
                   activate their orbs to run, exposing the objects
                   for use.

testclients      - simple clients to test the servers are working.
